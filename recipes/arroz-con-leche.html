    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Raisins (optional, for topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the rice, water, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the whole milk, evaporated milk, and sweetened condensed milk to the saucepan with the cooked rice. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Simmer the mixture over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until it thickens and becomes creamy (about 20-25 minutes).</li>
        <li>Stir in the granulated sugar and vanilla extract. Taste and adjust the sweetness as needed.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let the arroz con leche cool slightly.</li>
