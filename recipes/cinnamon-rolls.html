        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

            <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar (for filling)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened (for filling)</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar (for glaze)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk or heavy cream (for glaze)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (for glaze)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.</li>
            <li>Warm the milk and water until slightly warm (not hot) and add to the dry ingredients along with melted butter and egg. Mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise for 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a large rectangle and spread softened butter over it. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the butter.</li>
            <li>Tightly roll the dough into a log and cut it into 12 even pieces. Place the rolls in a greased baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>For the glaze, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Drizzle over the warm rolls before serving.</li>
